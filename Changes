        ADDITIONS:
        * Most non-parameterized types of the basic Moose type hierarchy
          are now supported.  Exceptions are ClassName and RoleName
        * Ability to re-use the type tests to build new ones via is_$type()
        IMPROVEMENTS:
        * Refactored generation of assert_Foo() to use a dispatch table
          and captures for quote_sub.
        FIXES:
        * Add AutoPrereq to dist.ini so Makefile.PL gets dependencies generated
